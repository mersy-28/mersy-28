# Hi there, I'm Emaan!

I'm a front-end development student at Nucamp currently diving into the world of React. By day, I write **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. By night, I *still* write **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**... but with more snacks. I'm passionate about making cool things on the web, even if it means breaking stuff along the way (and fixing it later... maybe)

## 🚀 About me
- Lifelong learner and proud betta fish mom 🐟
- Gamer at heart (Fortnite, Call of Duty, Overwatch, Animal Crossing: New Horizons)
- Passionate about languages, tech, and connecting with awesome people
- Love spending time with friends and family
